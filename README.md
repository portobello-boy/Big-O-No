# Upsurge 
A logic circuit simulator. This platform is designed to parse and evaluate boolean expressions and logic circuits.

## Platform Design
Upsurge is built on a MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS). As of now, it's more of an ERN stack. The backend for Upsurge is built on ExpressJS hosting a REST API, with endpoints available to test major features.  The frontend for Upsurge is built on ReactJS, hosting a dynamically interactive user interface (in the future).

The codebase for Upsurge is stored in the `upsurge` directory, and the frontend and backend platforms are separated into their own respective `frontend` and `backend` directories as well. Each service is built on NodeJS, so it uses the standard `npm` commands to run - you can find more documentation for this in the respective directories.
